Basic Encryption Tools Using JavaScript on ChromeOS

We'll create a simple web-based encryption tool using JavaScript that can:
âœ… Encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher (a basic shift cipher).
âœ… Encode and decode text using Base64 (a common encoding format).

---

ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Create Project Files

You'll need three files:

1. index.html (Webpage for user input)
2. style.css (Styling the page)
3. script.js (Encryption logic)

---

ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Create the HTML Interface

Open a text editor and create a file named index.html, then add the html code.

ðŸ”¹ Explanation for html code:

-Text area for user input.
-Number input for Caesar Cipher shift value.
-Buttons to encrypt/decrypt using Caesar Cipher and Base64 encoding.

----

ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Style the Page (CSS)

Create a new file named style.css and add the css code.

ðŸ”¹ Explanation for css code:

-Centers the content and styles the buttons.
-Text areas are resized for better visibility.
-Adds hover effects to buttons.

---

ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Implement Encryption Logic (JavaScript)

Create a new file named script.js and add the javascript code.

ðŸ”¹ Explanation :

-Caesar Cipher shifts each letter forward or backward in the alphabet.
-Base64 encoding converts text to a special format for data storage.
-Base64 decoding reverses the process.

---

ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Run the Project on ChromeOS

Method 1: Run Locally on ChromeOS

1. Open the Files app and navigate to your project folder.
2. Double-click on index.html â†’ It will open in Chrome.
3. Enter text, select encryption type, and click the buttons to test.

---

ðŸ”¹ Step 6: Testing & Examples

1. Caesar Cipher Example (Shift = 3)
Input: HELLO
Encrypted: KHOOR
Decrypted: HELLO

2. Base64 Example
Input: hello world
Encoded: aGVsbG8gd29ybGQ=
Decoded: hello world
